Here are the endpoints extracted from the API documentation in JSON format:

```
{
  "endpoints": [
    {
      "name": "Get Color",
      "description": "Get a requested color, its complementary and its grayscale in different formats",
      "method": "GET",
      "url": "https://color.serialif.com/{color}",
      "parameters": [
        {
          "name": "color",
          "type": "string",
          "description": "The color to retrieve"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Note that this endpoint is not a traditional API endpoint, but rather a color retrieval endpoint that can be called by sending a GET request to `https://color.serialif.com/{color}`. The `{color}` placeholder should be replaced with the desired color, which can be specified in various formats (e.g. keyword, HEX, RGB, HSL).
