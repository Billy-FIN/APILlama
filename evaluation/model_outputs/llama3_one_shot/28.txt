There are no endpoints extracted from the provided API documentation. The text appears to be a blog post or a tutorial on how to use a web API, but it does not contain any specific endpoint information.

However, I can extract some API-related information from the text:

* The API endpoint is `https://hellosalut.stefanbohacek.dev/`
* The API supports two modes: manual and automatic
* In manual mode, you can pass the visitor's default browser language and/or their IP address to the API
* In automatic mode, the API determines the correct language automatically
* The API returns a JSON response with the country code (or language code) and the translation for the word "Hello"

If you would like me to extract any other information from the text, please let me know!
