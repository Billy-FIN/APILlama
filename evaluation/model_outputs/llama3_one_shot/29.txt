Here are the endpoints extracted from the API documentation in JSON format:

```
{
  "endpoints": [
    {
      "name": "projects",
      "description": "All suggested projects on the site, ordered alphabetically.",
      "method": "GET",
      "url": "https://24pullrequests.com/projects.json"
    },
    {
      "name": "users",
      "description": "Load all users who have signed up to the site, ordered by how many contributions they have sent so far in December, also includes their organisation(s) and contributions.",
      "method": "GET",
      "url": "https://24pullrequests.com/users.json"
    },
    {
      "name": "user",
      "description": "Load information for a specific user.",
      "method": "GET",
      "url": "https://24pullrequests.com/users/{username}.json"
    },
    {
      "name": "organisations",
      "description": "Load all organisations that have signed up to the site, also includes the users that belong to each organisation.",
      "method": "GET",
      "url": "https://24pullrequests.com/organisations.json"
    },
    {
      "name": "organisation",
      "description": "Load information for a specific organisation.",
      "method": "GET",
      "url": "https://24pullrequests.com/organisations/{organisation_name}.json"
    },
    {
      "name": "pull_requests",
      "description": "Load all contributions by users of the site during December, ordered by newest first, also includes the user who made the contribution.",
      "method": "GET",
      "url": "https://24pullrequests.com/pull_requests.json"
    },
    {
      "name": "pull_requests_meta",
      "description": "Load information about all the contributions this year.",
      "method": "GET",
      "url": "https://24pullrequests.com/pull_requests/meta.json"
    }
  ]
}
```

Note that I've used placeholders (`{username}` and `{organisation_name}`) for the dynamic parts of the URLs, as they are not fixed in the documentation.
