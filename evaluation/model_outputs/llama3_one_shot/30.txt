It seems like you provided a large block of text, which is not a valid JSON format. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy to read and write. It is a text-based format that is used to store and transmit data.

To extract endpoints from the provided text, I would need to parse the text and identify the relevant information. However, without a valid JSON format, it is not possible to extract endpoints in a structured and organized manner.

If you can provide the text in a valid JSON format, I would be happy to help you extract the endpoints.
