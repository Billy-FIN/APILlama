The Genderize.io API is a tool that provides accurate gender classification from a name. The API uses a statistical approach to determine the likelihood of a name being male or female based on the ratio of males to females with a given name. The accuracy of the tool is based on whether a name is strictly used by one gender or as a unisex name, and a probability is returned with all predictions. The tool can be integrated with various programming languages, including Ruby, Python, Java, and more, through libraries such as SteelPangolin/genderize, genderize.io, and others. The API and CSV tool are free for up to 100 names/day, and the API key is not required for the free plan. The tool can also be integrated with customer relationship management (CRM) systems through Zapier. The API has multiple tiers of usage, with transparent pricing and no retention period. The tool is used by various industries, including customer analytics, academic research, and media, to infer genders from authors, characters, or public figures mentioned in texts. Some case studies include The Guardian, Nature, and The London School of Economics and Political Science.
