Scryfall is a platform that provides a REST-like API for ingesting Magic: The Gathering card data programmatically. The API exposes information available on the regular site in easy-to-consume formats.

**API Details**

*   The API is available at `https://api.scryfall.com`.
*   API requests are only served over HTTPS, using TLS 1.2 or better.
*   Requests will not be honored over plaintext HTTP.
*   The API uses UTF-8 character encoding for all responses.
*   Many fields will include characters that are not in the ASCII range.
*   Rate limits and good citizenship:
    *   Insert 50-100 milliseconds of delay between requests to the server at `api.scryfall.com` (i.e., 10 requests per second on average).
    *   Submitting excessive requests to the server may result in a HTTP 429 Too Many Requests status code.
    *   Continuing to overload the API after this point may result in a temporary or permanent ban of your IP address.
    *   The file origins used by the API, located at `*.scryfall.io`, do not have these rate limits.
    *   We encourage you to cache the data you download from Scryfall or process it locally in your own database, at least for 24 hours.

**API Endpoints**

*   The API has several endpoints, including:
    *   `Search Cards`: Perform advanced search queries to find cards by name, type, release date, legality, and more.
    *   `Card Objects`: Retrieve card data in various formats.
    *   `Card Imagery`: Retrieve card images in various formats.
    *   `Bulk Data`: Download Scryfall's entire database in compressed files.

**Using the API**

*   To use the API, you must first create an account on the Scryfall website and obtain an API key.
*   You can then use the API key to make requests to the API.
*   The API uses a REST-like syntax, with GET, POST, and other HTTP methods available.
