Here are the extracted endpoints in JSON format:

```
[
  {
    "endpoint": "/v1",
    "description": "List ALL COVID-19 cases per country. If no {country} parameter specified the full dataset will be returned."
  },
  {
    "endpoint": "/v1/{country}",
    "description": "Return COVID-19 cases for specified country. Specify {contry} parameter to extract results for this country only. To extract summary results for the whole world put 'world' value as {country} parameter."
  }
]
```

Note that the JSON output only includes the endpoints and their descriptions, as the API documentation does not provide additional information about the request parameters, response formats, or error handling.
