      "description": "Get a random Base Layer, Mixin, Condiment, Seasoning and Shell"
    },
    {
      "path": "/random/?full-taco=true",
      "description": "Get a random full taco recipe"
    },
    {
      "path": "/contributors/:recipe_type/:recipe_slug/",
      "description": "Get contributors for a certain recipe"

    {
      "path": "/contributors/:recipe_type/",
      "description": "Get a mapping of slugs for a given recipe type"
    },
    {
      "path": "/contributions/:github_username/",
