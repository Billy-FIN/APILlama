Based on the provided API documentation, I can extract the endpoints and output them in JSON format. Here is the extracted information:

```
{
  "endpoints": [
    {
      "path": "/{width}/{height}",
      "description": "Get a placeholder image of a bear"
    },
    {
      "path": "/g/{width}/{height}",
      "description": "Get a placeholder image of a bear (alternative path)"
    },
    {
      "path": "/{width}/{height}.jpg",
      "description": "Get a placeholder image of a bear (with.jpg extension)"
    }
  ]
}
```

Note that the `{width}` and `{height}` placeholders in the path represent the image size, which should be replaced with actual values (e.g., `200` and `300` for a 200x300 image).
