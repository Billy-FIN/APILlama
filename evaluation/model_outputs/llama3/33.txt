Based on the provided API documentation, I extracted the following endpoints:

```
[
  {
    "endpoint": "/",
    "description": "Convert JSON to JSONP (on-the-fly) for easy cross-domain data requests using pure JavaScript.",
    "parameters": [
      {
        "name": "url",
        "description": "The URL of the JSON data"
      },
      {
        "name": "callback",
        "description": "The callback function name"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

Note that the API only has one endpoint, which is the root URL (`"/"`) that accepts two parameters: `url` and `callback`.
