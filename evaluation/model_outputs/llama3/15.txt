Unfortunately, the provided text content is not an API documentation, but rather a README file for a project. It does not contain any API endpoints.

However, I can extract the information about the Transitland Datastore API from the text content. According to the README file, the API is available at `https://transit.land/api/v1`.

If you're looking for a JSON output, here is a simple JSON object with the extracted information:
```json
{
  "api_url": "https://transit.land/api/v1"
}
```
Please note that this is not a comprehensive API documentation, and you may need to consult the Transitland Datastore API documentation site for more information on the available endpoints and their usage.
