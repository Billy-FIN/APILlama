Here are the endpoints extracted from the API documentation in JSON format:

```
{
  "endpoints": [
    {
      "path": "/api/v2/entries/en/<word>",
      "description": "Get word definitions"
    }
  ]
}
```

Note that there is only one endpoint mentioned in the documentation, which is `/api/v2/entries/en/<word>`. This endpoint returns the definitions of a given English word. The `<word>` placeholder represents the word for which you want to retrieve the definitions.
