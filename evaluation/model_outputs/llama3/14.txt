Here are the endpoints extracted from the API documentation in JSON format:

```
[
  {
    "path": "/v1/quote/",
    "description": "Get a random quote each time, from all quotes."
  },
  {
    "path": "/v1/quote?censored",
    "description": "Don't show quotes which contain adult language."
  },
  {
    "path": "/v1/shows/<show_slug>",
    "description": "Get a random quote from the desired show."
  },
  {
    "path": "/v1/shows/",
    "description": "Get list of available shows slugs."
  }
]
```

Note that the `<show_slug>` in the `/v1/shows/<show_slug>` endpoint is a placeholder for a specific show slug, which can be obtained by querying the `/v1/shows/` endpoint.
