Here are the endpoints extracted from the API documentation in JSON format:

```
{
  "endpoints": [
    {
      "name": "projects",
      "url": "https://24pullrequests.com/projects.json"
    },
    {
      "name": "users",
      "url": "https://24pullrequests.com/users.json"
    },
    {
      "name": "users/{id}",
      "url": "https://24pullrequests.com/users/{id}.json"
    },
    {
      "name": "organisations",
      "url": "https://24pullrequests.com/organisations.json"
    },
    {
      "name": "organisations/{id}",
      "url": "https://24pullrequests.com/organisations/{id}.json"
    },
    {
      "name": "pull_requests",
      "url": "https://24pullrequests.com/pull_requests.json"
    },
    {
      "name": "pull_requests/meta",
      "url": "https://24pullrequests.com/pull_requests/meta.json"
    },
    {
      "name": "contributions",
      "url": "https://24pullrequests.com/pull_requests.json"
    }
  ]
}
```

Note that some endpoints have parameters (e.g. `{id}`) that need to be replaced with actual values when making a request.
