Here are the endpoints extracted from the API documentation in JSON format:

```
{
  "endpoints": [
    {
      "url": "https://image-charts.com/chart",
      "methods": ["GET", "POST"],
      "parameters": [
        {
          "name": "cht",
          "description": "Chart type"
        },
        {
          "name": "chd",
          "description": "Chart data"
        },
        {
          "name": "chs",
          "description": "Chart size"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Note that the API documentation does not provide a comprehensive list of endpoints, but rather a general overview of how to construct a chart URL. The provided URL is an example of a basic Chart API URL, and the documentation explains how to customize the chart by adding additional parameters.
