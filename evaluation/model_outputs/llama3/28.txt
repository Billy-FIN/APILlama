Here are the endpoints extracted from the API documentation in JSON format:

```
{
  "endpoints": [
    {
      "path": "/",
      "description": "Hello, Salut! API documentation"
    },
    {
      "path": "/?lang=LANGUAGECODE",
      "description": "Get the country code (or language code) and the translation for the word 'Hello' in the specified language"
    },
    {
      "path": "/?ip=IPADDRESS",
      "description": "Get the country code (or language code) and the translation for the word 'Hello' based on the visitor's IP address"
    },
    {
      "path": "/?cc=nl",
      "description": "Get the country code (or language code) and the translation for the word 'Hello' for the specified country code"
    },
    {
      "path": "/?mode=auto",
      "description": "Get the country code (or language code) and the translation for the word 'Hello' automatically determined by the API"
    }
  ]
}
```

Note that the endpoints are not fully formed URLs, but rather paths that can be combined with the base URL `https://hellosalut.stefanbohacek.dev/` to form a complete URL.
