Based on the provided API documentation, I extracted the endpoints and output in JSON format. Here is the result:

```
{
  "endpoints": [
    {
      "method": "GET",
      "url": "https://stoic.tekloon.net/stoic-quote",
      "description": "Returns a stoicism quote with author",
      "response": {
        "data": {
          "author": "Ryan Holiday",
          "quote": "True will is quiet humility, resilience, and flexibility; the other kind of will is weakness disguised by bluster and ambition."
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Note that there is only one endpoint documented in the provided API documentation, which is a GET request to retrieve a stoicism quote with author.
