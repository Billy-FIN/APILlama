Here are the extracted endpoints in JSON format:

```
{
  "endpoints": [
    {
      "name": "All Leagues Available",
      "path": "/leagues",
      "method": "GET",
      "description": "https://api-football-standings.azharimm.site/leagues"
    },
    {
      "name": "League Detail",
      "path": "/leagues/{id}",
      "method": "GET",
      "description": "https://api-football-standings.azharimm.site/leagues/eng.1"
    },
    {
      "name": "Seasons Available",
      "path": "/leagues/{id}/seasons",
      "method": "GET",
      "description": "https://api-football-standings.azharimm.site/leagues/eng.1/seasons"
    },
    {
      "name": "Standings",
      "path": "/leagues/{id}/standings",
      "method": "GET",
      "description": "https://api-football-standings.azharimm.site/leagues/eng.1/standings?season=2020&sort=asc"
    }
  ]
}
```

Note that the `{id}` in the path is a placeholder for the actual league ID, and the `?season=2020&sort=asc` in the Standings endpoint is a query parameter.
