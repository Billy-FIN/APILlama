Here are the endpoints extracted from the API documentation in JSON format:

```
{
  "endpoints": [
    {
      "path": "/<color>",
      "methods": ["GET"],
      "description": "Get a requested color, its complementary and its grayscale in different formats"
    }
  ]
}
```

Note that the endpoint path is `/` followed by the color value, and the method is GET. The description is a brief summary of what the endpoint does.
