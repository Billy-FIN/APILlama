Here are the endpoints extracted from the API documentation in JSON format:

```
{
  "endpoints": [
    {
      "url": "https://api.myip.com",
      "description": "Get IP address, country, and country code"
    }
  ]
}
```

Note that the API documentation only mentions a single endpoint, which is the base URL `https://api.myip.com`. The response format is JSON, and it returns the IP address, country, and country code.
